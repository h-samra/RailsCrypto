This Ruby on Rails website utilizes the CoinMarketCap API to fetch and parse up to date data. The application was written and ran on the Cloud 9 IDE. 

Using a devise database, I was able to build a user management system, so users can customize their private portfolio and track their crypto as it progresses. I used Ruby on Rails scaffolding to build individual crypto currency records. Using user IDs as a primary key, I associated the two database entities for easy usage.
Additionally, CSS with Bootstrap was used on tables, forms, panels, and buttons to gave the UI a clean minimalistic look.
